        This On Monday we started working with Tinker CAD and designed a <br>
        Rube Goldberg machiene with percise measurements so we could <br>
        build one in the future. Tinker CAD took me some time to get <br>
        used to but after i got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing. <br>
        My design for a Rube Goldberg machine used an inclined plane at which <br>
        a baseball would roll down. After rolling down the baseball would <br>
        fall into a basket which would pull a string. Said string would go <br>
        around a pulley which would lift a lever with a nail attatched to the  <br>
        end. The nail would then pop a balloon. Then on friday we had the <br>
        challenge of the week, being the challenge of making a household <br> 
        appliance in Tinker CAD. For this challenge I made an eraser. The <br>
        challenge of getting the logo right was fun and I learned how to <br>
        use/manipulate shapes better. However while I did not win it was a <br>
        fun experience and I got better at working in CAD.

          This week we did a lot of work on perfecting our tinker <br> 
          cad designs for the rube goldberg machine. I personally <br>
          changed a couple measurements and altered my design slightly <br>
          for the basket for my baseball. Then we formed groups where <br>
          we decided which of our designs we wanted to use for our <br> 
          group project. My group chose to go with my design, one <br> 
          that was quite different from their in how it opperated. <br>
          My group-mates while having different designs all went with <br>
          a similar method of a baseball dropped onto a lever that <br>
          would push a car which would pop a balloon. However my <br>
          design opperated on a baseball rolling down an inclined <br>
          plane into a basket. The basket would then fall down, <br>
          pulling a string which would in turn pull a lever with a <br> 
          spike attatched to pop a balloon. After deciding that we <br> 
          would use my design as a group we looked over the design <br>
          and checked for any erriors with scaling and called it a <br>
          day. Then on friday we did a design challenge where we had <br>
          to draft out an E and have a partner produce it. This <br>
          challenge taught me the importance of making percise <br> 
          measurements and percise drafting so someone else can get <br>
          the same result as intended.

      <center><p>
          On this week we focused a lot on making our Rube Goldberg machines. <br>
          After designing them the week prior we finally started building <br>
          them on Monday. My group chose my desgn and after a couple small <br>
          changes we got to work building. Within the class period we were <br>
          able to finish building our machine with all of its components. <br>
          We were able to work together well and efficantly build the machine <br>
          with time to spare. As well as do a couple tests with our remaining <br>
          time. On wednesday we worked more on our rube goldburg machines <br> 
          however as our group was finished we had time to walk around and <br> 
          talk to other groups about their projects. On friday we built a <br>
          paper boat with weights on it. Our boat had a large bottom and high <br>
          walls to keep water out. With our good design our boat lasted 5 <br> 
          minutes at which point it sank. All in all this week was fun and <br>
          I enjoyed friday's challenge quite a bit.
